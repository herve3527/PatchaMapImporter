--WHAT IS IT--
A map loading/filtering tool for the game BMX PIPE by MASH: http://bmxstreets.com/pipe/ BUY THIS AWESOME GAME (and the only one we have now) AND THE _REAL_ UPCOMING BMX STREETS GAME.
You must own the game legally to use this mod so BUY THIS GAME TO SUPPORT MASH.

PIPE is a physics based BMX experience built for the BMX community designed to simulate realistic BMX motion. Perform over 50 aerial stunts, grind any corner, send big airs in the PIPE! PIPE also includes some fun Easter Eggs for those willing to explore and think outside the box.

--WHY IT EXISTS--
The modding community is creating so much maps that I can't remember what's the name of the map i want to play. I created this mod for adding personnal datas to the maps (name, rating, riding types, authors, descriptions) and an UI to filter the maps using your datas.
This data are stored inside a JSON file in the CustomMaps folder. This mod DOES NOT RENAME NOR CHANGE THE MAP FILES. It only use this json file to store data.

--HOW IT WORK--
You need BMX PIPE 1.9.9, Unity Mod Manager installed and running as well. 
Copy the folder in the zip file "PatchaMapImporter" inside the folder "Mods" of the game. 
Follow the tutorial in the pinned messages in the #help channel in https://discord.gg/S89swkZ for installing Mods inside PIPE BMX.

To use it, launch the game, go to the Community Center Map, and press the key "L" (L like "List"). the key "M" is already used by the legacy PipeWorksMapImporter, so you can use both at the same time.
This UI list all the maps you have in your CustomMaps folder, end permit you to filter the map using the top part of the ui.
Each listed maps has two boutons : 
- "edit properties" : to add datas to maps
- "load this map!" : to play the map.

You can edit maps properties from this UI using the button "load this map!" -OR- after the maps is loaded, you can press directly "E" (for "Edit"). Easy to put the description of the map you're currently playing. 
Please note that if you use the game menu to go back to the original maps of BMX PIPE, the edit window will show the last modded map you play.


Source code will be pushed to github soon.
